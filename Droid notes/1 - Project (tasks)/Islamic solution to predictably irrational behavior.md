#### chapter 7: the high value of ownership
- problem: we often overvalue what we have because of 3 quirks. first, we fall in love with what we already have. second, we focus on what we may lose, rather than what we may gain. third, we assume the other party will see the transactions from the same perspective as we do.
- solution: Zuhud. never assume total ownership of everything.
