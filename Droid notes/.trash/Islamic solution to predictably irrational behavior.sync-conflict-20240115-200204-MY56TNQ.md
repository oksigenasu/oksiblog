#### Chapter 7: the high value of ownership
- problem: we often overvalue what we have because of 3 quirks. first, we fall in love with what we already have. second, we focus on what we may lose, rather than what we may gain. third, we assume the other party will see the transactions from the same perspective as we do.
- solution: Zuhud. never assume total ownership of everything.
#### Chapter 8: Keeping doors open
- problem: giving a clear goal and simple setup, people are adept at doing things. keeping too many options wastes time and people often not realize the consequences of not choosing, even if the options are only between two.
- solution: istikharah. choose an option, and pray istikharah to let it play out. whatever happen, its already ordained.
#### Chapter 9: the effect of expectation 
- Problem: people perspective are greatly influenced by expectation. knowing whats inside a drink beforehand, can affect how its taste. having a stereotypes labeled to a person, also affect their performance.
- solution: Husnudzan. always expect the good and talk about good
