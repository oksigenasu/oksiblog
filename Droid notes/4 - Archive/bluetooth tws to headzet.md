why buy 400K Sony bluetooth headset when you can transplant a 100k TWS into a 400K headset and spend 6 hours operation time ðŸ˜‚

After 3 years, finally i decided to transplant my bluetooth TWS into this headset unit.

the prochedure is fairly simple. just need to crack open the headset and the TWS, and swap the speaker output.

at first i was skeptical that this bluetooth TWS can drive the headset speaker. but after testing it, the volume is still decent. 

to enable touch sensor from tws to penetrate the case of the headset, i added a metal from a cutter to increase the sensitivity of the sensor. 

to charge the battery, i modify the audio jack to accept 5V from the left channel and route it to the tws charge input. this way i lose the ability to use audio input from cable, but its work for now.

its far from perfect, but usable. next i want to enable audio jack for input, moving the charging port to the side via detachable magnet plug, and maybe rebuild the foam pad?

see u again in the next 3 years...
